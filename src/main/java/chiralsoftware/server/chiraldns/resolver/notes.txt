Alg:

If name is not fully resolved and non-star, go up the zones.  For each
zone, check for NS or SOA.  If SOA is found, we have an AA NXDOMAIN.
If NS is found, return it.

If it is fully-resolved (or has a star) it CAN'T be an NXDOM and so it
must have an NS record.  Keep going up the zones til an ns is found.
